A workflow is a series of steps a user goes through to complete a task. It is visually represented as a series of steps and the transition between those steps. A step can be a) a mobile app screen or b) a condition node

A workflow on ZORP consists of: 
1. Steps 
2. Transitions

## Creating a workflow:​
With ZORP, you can manage multiple workflows at the same time. For example, a user performing delivery can also use the same ZORP app to execute an attendance task. The list of available workflows are present in the  tab. To create a new workflow, click on the New Workflow button.

## Creating Steps and Transitions:​
All Workflows need to have initialStep and terminalSteps. Initial step is the first screen the user sees when he starts the task and terminalSteps are the screens where the tasks assigned to a User come to an End. By default the ZORP builder provides you with a NEW Step (initalStep) and COMPLETED Step (terminalStep).

To create a new step,
- Click on Create Node
- Click on Create a Step
- Connect it with another node to create a transition

Any new Transition on ZORP is called `NEXT` by default. The transition name is what the user sees as the Buttons that take them to the next screens.
