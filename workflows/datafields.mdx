2. Data type (more about supported data types here)
3. Default value
4. Create Time Field: This property indicates if this data field will be an input when a task is created. If selected, an option to mark the field as mandatory will be shown
   Types of data fields

   User data fields: As the name suggests, these are defined by the workflow author and are specific to each workflow. More details here
