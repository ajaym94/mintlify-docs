Leveraging Zorp Automations, you can seamlessly integrate with various external systems, your organization's custom APIs, and implement intelligent logic within your Zorp app screens, delivering a highly adaptive and efficient user experience. See some examples of what you can build with Automations here.

## Types of Automations
There are four main types of automations in Zorp:

1. Screen Transitions: Automations that are executed during screen transitions, allowing you to perform validations or integrate with external systems as users navigate between screens.

2. Screen On Load: Automations that control the appearance and behavior of a screen when the screen is loaded. This can include fetching data from REST APIs or databases, hiding or showing specific screen components, and other dynamic adjustments. ​

3. In-Screen: Automations that modify screen components based on user interactions, such as controlling the visibility of components or loading data from external systems during screen interactions.​

4. Task Events: Automations that can be configured to trigger by task-level events, such as task assignment, unassignment, creation, deletion, update, or changes to a task's scheduled slot.

## Automation Components

Every automation in Zorp consists of the following components:

- Trigger: At least one trigger is required for each automation. Triggers define the event for which the automation will be executed, such as a specific user interaction or a task event.

- Validation (optional): A validation determines whether an automation should be executed or not. If a validation is specified, the automation will only be executed if the validation returns true. See more details about validations here

- Action Blocks: An automation can have one or more action blocks, each containing multiple conditions and actions. All conditions within an action block must be met (return true) for the actions in the action block to be executed.  

### Creating Automations
The entry point for each of the automation different based on the type of automation. Refer to the individual automation page for more details

To create an automation in Zorp, follow these steps:
- Navigate to the Zorp app editor and select the screen or task event where you want to add an automation.
- Click on the "Automations" tab, and then click the "Add Automation" button.
- Configure the trigger(s) for your automation.
- Optionally, define a validation for your automation.
- Create one or more action blocks, specifying the conditions and actions for each block.

Once you have created and configured your automation, save your changes and test your app to ensure that the automation is functioning as expected. By using Zorp Automations, you can create more dynamic and interactive app experiences that respond to user inputs and external data, improving the overall usability and functionality of your app.
