## Workflow Builder
Workflows are like a blueprint of your process. For example, a workflow is like a model of a house. Multiple houses can be built on the same model. Similarly, multiple tasks can be created based on the same workflow. The workflow has information about the list of steps the user needs to go through to complete the process. It is visually represented as a series of nodes and the transition that connect the nodes.
