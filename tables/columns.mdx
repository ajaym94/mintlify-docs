## Introduction

Zorp allows you to set column permissions to control who can view and edit a specific column under a Table. This is useful when you want to restrict access to sensitive information or when you want to ensure that only certain people can edit a specific column.

## Setting Column Permissions

Follow these steps to fix who can view and edit a specific column under a Table -

1. Go to Column actions
2. Select Column Permissions from the menu
3. Specify who can view and edit based on roles, teams or user names
4. Hit Save

PS - If you havenâ€™t configured column permissions, by default everyone on your team has access to view and edit.
