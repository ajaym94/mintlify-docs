## What are Column Permissions?

Zorp allows you to set column permissions to control who can view and edit a specific column under a Table. This is useful when you want to restrict access to sensitive information or when you want to ensure that only certain people can edit a specific column.

PS - If you havenâ€™t configured column permissions, by default everyone on your team has access to view and edit.
