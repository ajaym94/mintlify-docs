With access control you can share access to each Table and its Records with your team members based on specific permissions. For granular control, you can customize the permissions for each Column within the Table. Grant access based on team, role or independent user level.

Now you can control who can -

A. View, Duplicate, Delete and Share Tables

B. Manage Table Columns

C. View, Create, Edit, Delete, Design layout and Add comments to Table Records

D. Manage Table Automations


We have created 4 default permissions for you - Creator, Editor, Commenter and Viewer.

You can change the actions that can be performed by an Editor, Commenter and Viewer only. You also have the option to create a custom permission.

## Creating Custom Permissions

Follow these steps to create a custom permission for your Table and Record

1. Click on “Add new”.
2. Assign a unique name to the permission.
3. Checkmark the actions you want to allow.
4. Hit Save.

PS - There are a few dependent actions. For example, if the permission allows for “Delete table records”, it automatically allows for “View table records”. You cannot remove “View table records.”
